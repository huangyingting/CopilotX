## Declarative Agent - Customer Insights Assistant
### What is Declarative Agent?
Declarative agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot are custom AI assistants you can build by simply defining their behavior, instructions, and knowledgeâ€”no coding required.

### Demo - Customer Insights Assistant

#### Create a Declarative Customer Insights Assistant Agent
Create a declarative agent in M365 copilot
![Declarative-Agent](./copilot-studio/Declarative-Agent.jpg)
Try prompts like:
```
Provide insights on [Customer Name] based on the latest data.

Analyze [Customer Name] investment globally and draw a chart.
```

The original prompt lacks adequate truth-grounding, for example, if asking "What key insights can be drawn from [Customer Name]'s Q2 2025 results?", it may not provide the halucination answer.

The enhanced prompt incorporates several key improvements:
- ReAct Framework Integration
- Truth-Grounding Mechanisms
- Enhanced Structure
- Professional Methodology
- Strategic Focus
